# BeykarWebs-WordPress
BeykarWebs Portfolio. This is actually my own site which started life as a static one page responsive design portfolio using Bootstrap, which I then turned into a WordPress theme. The blog section is dynamically generated via WordPress. It is a work in progress, and I aim to turn this into a fully dynamic WP theme using WP dev plugins such as Advanced Custom Fields for example, along with OOP php.
